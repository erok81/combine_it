# combine_it

## Tool to combine multiple spreadsheets into one
### Steps to use:
- Enter folder location. If location is invalid, message will appear /n
- Enter common file name, asterix wild card, and .extension type (ex. .xlsx)
- Enter new file name. If not unique corrent file will be over written
## Note: 
Program was made with specific sheet in mind. If using something with no headers and footers, edit row 43 to remove header and skipfooter options. Will add these as user inputs at some point.
